configuration file as role-based access control system. 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 subject_asa

has the role defined in the supplied argument.

    return 1 if subject_asa($self, $options, $role);

=head2 subject_can

The subject_can method (found in every permissions class) validates whether a user
is responsible for (or is authorized to operate) a particular operation and can
